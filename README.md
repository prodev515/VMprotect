When creating new files, these must be added to the [manifest.json](https://github.com/WordPress/wpcs-docs/blob/master/manifest.json) file. 

Removing files also requires updating the [manifest.json](https://github.com/WordPress/wpcs-docs/blob/master/manifest.json) file. After deletion and sync with DevHub, the page also needs to be manually deleted from DevHub.
